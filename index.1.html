    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    <p> Paragraph 1: If I could live anywhere in the world, 
        it would be in a place with a strong connection to nature. 
        I would want to live in a location that <b>Bikram</b> offers breathtaking <i>Bikram</i> landscapes and endless outdoor activities, 
        such as hiking, skiing, and kayaking.<br>BikramI would love to wake up every day to
        the sounds of birds singing and the scent of fresh pine in the air.
        I believe that being surrounded by natural beauty has a positive impact on one's mental and physical well-being, 
        and I would relish the opportunity to immerse myself in it every day. Paragraph 2: On the other hand, 
        I would also like to live in a place with a rich cultural heritage and vibrant city life. 
        I envision a location with a mix of ancient traditions and modern amenities, 
        offering a unique blend of history and innovation. 
        I would want to live in a place where I can attend concerts, try new foods, and explore museums and art galleries.

        The scariest thing that ever happened to me was when I was home alone and heard strange noises coming from the basement.
        I hesitated to go down and investigate, but eventually mustered up the courage and cautiously made my way down the stairs. 
        To my surprise, I found that the source of the noise was a broken pipe and water was gushing out, flooding the entire basement.
        he experience was terrifying because I was alone and felt helpless in that moment, not knowing what to do or how to stop the water. 
        It was a reminder to always be prepared for unexpected situations and to never take safety for granted.
